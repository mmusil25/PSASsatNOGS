# TSAR
Test Stand Automation and Regulation system for the Portland State Aerospace Society's (PSAS) Liquid fuel engine test stand.

## New Member Onboarding

If you are interested in joining the TSAR team, please reference 'Onboarding.pdf' in the root of this repository. 

## Definitions

LFETS - Liquid fuel engine test stand

Module - Valves, sensors, the engine, the igniter. Anything that is a single moving, sensing or functional unit.

## Test Stand Automation and Regulation System Overview

The TSAR group will build an embedded controls and data acquisition system (CDAQ) for a liquid fuel rocket engine test stand for the Portland State Aerospace Society. Solving this issue is vital because developing a liquid fuel rocket engine will decrease PSASâ€™s cost per launch drastically while also opening the door for considerably higher peak apogees. Without the development of a safe CDAQ solution for the test stand, PSAS cannot reach its goals. The TSAR solution is a student led, in house solution which will create a custom taylored, safety oriented soluton for test stand CDAQ. Our solution is unique because it will be entirely open-sourced with a focus on repeatability and simplicity to allow other amateur rocket groups to benefit from the liquid rocket engine technology. We will use an off-the-shelf Beagle Bone Black embedded computer and a Marionette DAQ board (a former PSU capstone) to implement this system and all software will be developed by the TSAR team of PSU undergraduates.

## Key Requirements

The following aspects of the system are mandatory. More details are present in the document 'TSAR_Requirements.docx' in the root of this repository. The core features are:

1. Interactive graphical dashboard for state control
2. Safety and security of the entire system
3. Clean, thorough documentation of all group efforts including well-commented code, photographic and videographic artifacts, and thorough usage and debugging resources. 


#### What are the major deliverables?
A graphical front end with safety features. A nervous system of sensors and actuators with realtime data output from the RPi3 to the front-end.

#### How will we get to those deliverables and the deadline?

Divison of the project into: 

High level application design - GUI, interactive LFETS diagram, state control, security features, real-time data output, data storage

Mid-level system architecture - Discretization of the firing sequence into states, designation of states for each module.

Low-Level sensor specification and sensing - Specification of each sensor's range, and performance characteristics and interfacing of the sensors and actuatuators with the marionette/Rpi3.

#### What are the milestones we need to hit?
October: assessment of each High,mid,low system requirements and the tools which will be used for each system.
November: Completed state-machine design, Front end specifications completed, sensor specifications completed.
December: Interface with the fuel sensor or other LFETS needs and provide data output for their project.
January: All sensors specified, all valves under control.
February: Interface with all sensors and have real-time, time alligned data output.
March: 
April:
May: Hot fire :)
#### Are there dependencies that could impact the timeline?

It is important that we allign with the needs of the test stand team's needs. In addition, we need to begin delivering a part's list to the Beta project people.
